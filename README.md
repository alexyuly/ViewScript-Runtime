making app dev make sense

## Working with the Compendium IDE

### ðŸ§­ Explorer

#### ðŸ§± Components Tab

The Components Tab lists your open components. Components are the visible building blocks of your apps (including your apps themselves).

Each component has Properties, Storage, Children, and Events.

Components can do things! A component can...

âœ… accept Properties, immutable instances of concepts passed down by a parent

âœ… maintain Storage, mutable instances of concepts that only the component can access

âœ… have Children, by constructing instances of other components and passing properties to them

âœ… fire Events, which it forwards from its own children

#### ðŸ“š Concepts Tab

The Concepts Tab lists your open concepts. Concepts are the types of information your apps can understand and store.

Each concept has Properties and Methods.

### ðŸ”Ž Inspector

The Inspector shows detail for items selected in the Explorer.

### ðŸ‘€ Viewer

The Viewer shows a preview of items selected in the Explorer.
