making app dev make sense

## Working with the Compendium IDE

### 🧭 Explorer

#### 🧱 Components Tab

The Components Tab lists your open components. Components are the visible building blocks of your apps (including your apps themselves).

Each component has Properties, Storage, Children, and Events.

🧪 Components are inert prototypes, but a component instance does things! A component instance can...

✅ Accept Properties: immutable concept instances passed down by its parent.

✅ Maintain Storage: mutable concept instances that only the component instance can access.

✅ Have Children, by creating instances of components and passing properties to them.

✅ Fire Events, which it forwards from its children to its parent.

#### 📚 Concepts Tab

The Concepts Tab lists your open concepts. Concepts are the types of information your apps can understand and store.

Each concept has Properties and Methods.

### 🔎 Inspector

The Inspector shows detail for items selected in the Explorer.

### 👀 Viewer

The Viewer shows a preview of items selected in the Explorer.
