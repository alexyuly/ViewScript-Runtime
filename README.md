# The Compendium

**Welcome to the Compendium!**

From here, you will embark on a magical journey, _building apps for web browsers_, in an integrated tool with everything you need for victory. 

üßôü™Ñ‚ú®üíñüå∫

## Motivation

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are amazing tools, and web browsers are a viable platform for building and distributing apps worldwide.

_But the web has a problem. An elephant in the room, maybe._

That elephant is JavaScript. üêò

For a decade or so, web app developers have increasingly embraced JavaScript as the cornerstone of their process, above HTML and CSS. It's natural, right? Apps have complex logic. Apps do things and have side effects. HTML and CSS fall far short of providing all the tools to build standalone apps for web browsers. They were designed for a world where web apps were thin shells, fully controlled by servers. They were designed to present static content once to a user, and only to update upon navigation or reload.

Now, JavaScript's gains in capability and performance have made HTML and CSS tools in a dynamic runtime toolkit for app development. Technically, the DOM, CSSOM, and JavaScript fit together well. But elements and styles need continual maintenance to keep them updated when parameters change. Moreover, logic and requirements need similar care to keep them fresh as a business evolves. JavaScript provides insufficient assistance in these critical areas.

In fact, vanilla JavaScript fails resoundingly at the task of maintaining large web apps over long time periods by unstable development teams. Unfortunately, this is a common situation in software development. First Angular, then React, now Svelte, have stepped up to fill the gaps left by JavaScript. The advent of TypeScript has eased considerable pain. But, it all feels just a bit incoherent, stitched together, too chaotic, inefficient, and unproductive... Maybe you feel this, too?

**The Compendium** provides a potential path forward for web app development. It reinforces HTML, CSS, and JavaScript best practices, by bridging gaps and balancing concerns holistically across the web trinity. It is _NOT_ intended to replace HTML, CSS, or JavaScript as fundamental web browser technologies. Many or most web-based content will never need the Compendium. Only dynamic web apps can benefit from it, and even then probably only greenfield apps with limited external integrations.

I have three key design goals:
- **Dramatically reduce the bloat** of web apps, in terms of dependency quality and quantity, file size, and runtime performance.
- **Eliminate boilerplate code** for web apps, by requiring consistent, predictable design patterns for components and systems.
- **Elevate ubiquitous technical terminology** in apps and products, shared across R&D by engineers, designers, and managers.

## High-Level

### Identifiers

Each `[identifier]` is delimited by whitespace, case insensitive, and:
- if enclosed by backticks, then any characters except line breaks and backticks;
- else, a case-insensitive sequence of characters including a-z and hyphens.

## Components üß±

Components are the building blocks of apps.

- `Component [identifier]`

Each component may declare these items:

- Data (input and storage)
  - üîª **Parameters**
    - `Take [identifier] of [concept]`
    - `Take optional [identifier] of [concept]`
    - `Handle [identifier] of [component]`
    - `Handle optional [identifier] of [component]`
  - üü® **Stores**
    - `Let [identifier] be [expression]`
- Operation (execution and output)
  - üîµ **Units**
    - `Create [identifier]`
  - üî∫ **Events**
    - `Will [identifier]`
    - `Will [identifier] [concept]`
    - `Will [identifier] optional [concept]`

## Concepts üìö

Concepts are the building blocks of data in apps.

- `Concept [identifier]`
- `Concept [identifier] extends [concept]`

Each concept may have these declarations:

- Data (input and storage)
  - üîª **Parameters**
    - `Take [identifier] of [concept]`
    - `Take optional [identifier] of [concept]`
  - üü® **Stores**
    - `Let [identifier] be [value]`
- Manipulation (transformation and production)
  - ‚ö° **Actions**
    - `Can [identifier]`
    - `Can [identifier] [concept]`
    - `Can [identifier] optional [concept]`
  - üß™ **Methods**
    - `Makes [identifier] from [expression]`
    - `Makes [identifier] of [concept] from [expression]`
    - `Makes [identifier] of optional [concept] from [expression]`

## Environments üåé

Environments pass down variables to apps when they build.

- `Environment [identifier]`

Each environment may have these declarations:

- üì¶ **Builds**

## Finder

**Finder** shows a searchable tree of your open files, with a summary of the items within each one.

## Editor

**Editor** shows editable content for the items selected in Finder.

## Viewer

**Viewer** shows a preview of the items selected in Finder, which may be edited and manipulated.

## Code Examples

### "Hello, World!" (Stylish Version)

```
Component `Hello World`

Let hovered be false

Create <main>
  content = <p>
    content = "Hello, world!"
    background = if hovered "white" else "black"
    border-color = "currentcolor"
    border-style = "solid"
    border-width = "1px"
    color = if hovered "black" else "white"
    cursor = "pointer"
    font = "24px sans-serif bold"
    padding = "48px"
    On pointerenter
      Hovered: enable
    On pointerleave
      Hovered: disable
  align-items = "center"
  background = "white"
  display = "flex"
  height = "100%"
  justify-content = "center"
  position = "fixed"
  width = "100%"

```

### Counter With Button And Timer

```
Component Counter

Let count be 0

Create <p>
  content = "The count is {count}."

Create <button>
  content = "Click me!"
  On click
    Count: add 1

Create timer
  loops = true
  paused = count: `is less than` 100
  period = 1000
  On time
    Count: add 1

```

### To-do List (Rudimentary Version)

```
Component `To-do List`

Let to-dos be new list of `to-do item`

Create <form> of `to-do item`
  content =
  - <label>
      content =
      - "New To-do:"
      - <input>
          name = "text"
          type = "text"
  - <button>
      content = "Add to list"
      type = "submit"
  On submit
    To-dos: push new `to-do item`
      text = it.data.text

Create <ul>
  content = to-dos: map to view

```

```
Component `To-do Item`

Take model of `to-do item`

Create <li>
  content = <label>
    content =
    - <input>
        checked = model.completed
        type = "checkbox"
    - Model.text
    On click
      Model: complete

```

```
Concept `To-do Item`

Take text of string

Let completed be false

Can complete
  Completed: enable

Makes view from creating `to-do item`
  Model = this

```
