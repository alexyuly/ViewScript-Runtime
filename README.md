## Working with the Compendium IDE

### ðŸ§­ Explorer

#### ðŸ§± Components Tab

The Components Tab lists your open components. Components are the visible building blocks of your apps (including your apps themselves).

Each component has Properties, Storage, Children, and Events.

ðŸ§ª Components are inert prototypes, but component instances do things! A component instance can...

âœ… Accept Properties: immutable concept instances passed down by its parent.

You can use this to...
- pass environment variables to an app deployment (which is like a component instance)
- pass custom traits and elements to a reusable design component or a part of your app

âœ… Maintain Storage: mutable concept instances that only the component instance can access.

You can use this to...
- keep temporary state while a component is in use
- store values in memory while an app is running
- save and load data from external persistent storage

âœ… Have Children, by creating component instances and passing properties to them.

âœ… Fire Events to its parent, by responding when its children fire events.

#### ðŸ“š Concepts Tab

The Concepts Tab lists your open concepts. Concepts are the types of information your components can understand and store.

Each concept has Properties and Methods.

ðŸ’¡ A concept defines a data type along with pure functions of that data type.

### ðŸ”Ž Inspector

The Inspector shows detail for items selected in the Explorer.

### ðŸ‘€ Viewer

The Viewer shows a preview of items selected in the Explorer.
