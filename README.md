making app dev make sense

## Working with the Compendium IDE

### ðŸ§­ Explorer

#### ðŸ§± Components Tab

The Components Tab lists your open components. Components are the visible building blocks of your apps (including your apps themselves).

Each component has Properties, Storage, Children, and Events.

ðŸ§ª Components are inert prototypes, but a component instance does things! A component instance can...

âœ… Accept Properties: immutable concept instances passed down by its parent.

âœ… Maintain Storage: mutable concept instances that only the component instance can access.

âœ… Have Children, by creating instances of components and passing properties to them.

âœ… Fire Events, which it forwards from its children to its parent.

#### ðŸ“š Concepts Tab

The Concepts Tab lists your open concepts. Concepts are the types of information your apps can understand and store.

Each concept has Properties and Methods.

### ðŸ”Ž Inspector

The Inspector shows detail for items selected in the Explorer.

### ðŸ‘€ Viewer

The Viewer shows a preview of items selected in the Explorer.
